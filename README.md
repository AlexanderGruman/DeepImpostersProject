# Deep learning based analysis of edgent hebrew sources

This project is a research study rather than a development project.

Our goal is to investigate and try to enlight new knowledge about the authorship of ancient Jewish texts—using existing computational methods as analytical tools.

Along the way, we will explore the following:
- how to adapt natural language processing tools to the unique challenges of ancient texts
- determine the appropriate methods for analyzing the material
- and carefully select which historical writings are suitable for comparison

Keywords: Authorship attribution in Jewish texts, Natural Language Processing (NLP) ,Deep imposters approach, Deep Learning for Stylometry.
